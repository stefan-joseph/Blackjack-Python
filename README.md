    #### Description:

    The following is a description for my final CS50P project titled 'Blackjack'. As you may have already guessed, this is a project where the user can play blackjack against an automated dealer. There are two main parts to this project. The first part is the main function that guides the user through the process of the blackjack game. The objective of the game is to reach $200 before running out of money. The user begins the game with $100. Once the user either reaches $200+ or $0, the program finishes executing. The second main part of the program is a class aptly titled 'Blackjack'. Within this class are methods and instance variables representing the actions and pieces required for playing a casino-style blackjack game which I will go into more detail below.

    The program begins by welcoming the user and asking if they would like to play blackjack. The player is then registered in a dict variable with their first name - for a more personal experience - and their starting purse - a cool $100. The rules are briefly explained to the user (as outlined above) and the user begins their first hand of the game by being prompted to wager either $5, $10 or $25. The user must only enter one of these three choices numerically otherwise they will be re-prompted. A '$' can be included or omitted in their response.

    Once the wager for the hand is placed a standard 52-card deck is generated and rearranged randomly with the 'random.shuffle' library. When a card is randomly chosen from this deck with the deal_card method, it is eliminated from the deck as well, simulating the experience of playing with a real card deck. The deck length quickly approaches 0 making the cards being dealt more and more predictable. This is a great oppurtunity to practice counting cards. Once the deck runs out, a fresh deck is produced and shiffled no matter which stage in the hand the program is running. The user is notified when this happens.

    To start a hand in blackjack, two cards are dealt to both the player and the dealer. One of the dealer's cards, however, remain face down as per the rules of blackjack. This card value is replaced with a '?' and the real value of the card is saved in the variable 'dealers_down_card'. Now its the player's turn to make decisions until wither they are happy with their hand value or have busted (gone over 21). When a user 'hits' they receive another card. When a user 'stands' they don't take anymore cards and the dealer begins it's actions. A player can also choose to 'double' only when they have two cards in their hand. To double is to take only one more card and double their original bet. If at any point the player goes over 21 and busts, the player losees their wager amount and the dealer does not commit any further actions. A new hand is dealt.

    If the player ends their turn without busting, the dealer starts their turn. In reality, it can hardly be called a 'turn' because in a casino-style game of blackjack the dealer does not make any decisions. They just follow a set of fixed rules. This is great news for a programmer like myself because I have very little machine learning experience at this point and would most likely program a poor decision-making dealer. The dealer must hit on 16 or lower and stand on anything above 16 even if it means taking another card when they already have the player beat. If the dealer doesn't bust following this rigid procedure, the value of the hands are compared and the one with higher value wins. If they have the same value it's a draw.

    An interesting rule with blackjack, is that an ace, in this game represented with 'A', can be counted as either 11 or 1. To write this functionality, my method called get_hand_toal first counts all aces as 11. if the total of the hand is above 21, it loops through the hand again turningthe first ace it finds to a 1. This process is repeated unit all the aces in the hand have been changed to 1's and the total is above 21. This ensures that the total returned is with the aces representing the best possible value in the hand.

    As I was creating this program, I was wondering how I would create an automated player who counts cards and factors that into their game choices in order to maximize their probability of winning. Good thing I'll be taking CS50AI next!
